Dotfiles
========

Some of my . files I have lying around on my machines.
------------------------------------------------------

Feel free to poke around, and if you have any tips... share the love.

### To Update the Vim Scripts

    bin/update-vim

### To Deploy the . Files

    bin/deploy

The only files deployed will be Vim files, .gitignore, and .bashrc; the rest of the files in this repo are for reference only.
